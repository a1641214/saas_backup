The basis of an Ethnography of Communication is that what language is cannot be separated from how and why it is used. Accordingly, the focus is on an investigation of how language varies according to context. A key figure in the field is Dell Hymes, the American linguist who coined the term and who proposed the core elements of the approach in the mid C20th. Language and Ethnography of Communication is located within the broad field of sociolinguistics and related traditions are also introduced. Of particular relevance is functional linguistics which models the relationship between context and language and proposes language variation as linked either to the users of language or to the use of language. 

At a practical level the course will introduce ethnographic work which has been conducted on specific topics and in particular geographic locations, while at the same time conducting ethnographic observations within a chosen community or site of interaction, for example a coffee shop, a supermarket, a gym or an office. The course is activity based and students are encouraged to engage in collecting and analysing data related to authentic language use in the broad community. The variations of language use that are found in relation to age, gender, ethnicity, geographical location and social structure are some of the areas for investigation in the course."

Even static civil structures such as bridges and buildings exhibit a dynamic response, which must be considered during design and construction of such systems.
This course introduces the fundamental concepts of vibrating dynamical systems, from single degree of freedom systems through to continuous and multi-degree of freedom systems.  Design of vibration control devices, such as vibration isolators and vibration absorbers, is also considered.  A module on engineering acoustics covers the fundamentals of acoustics, and introduction to psychoacoustics, general noise control, and occupational and environmental noise assessment.
Concurrently, this course also addresses how to control such dynamic systems using modern state-space control.  This involves time domain descriptions of dynamic systems using state-space system models.  The characteristics responsible for the dynamic response (poles, zeros, eigenvalues) are presented.  Control laws using state-space are introduced, including specification of controller characteristics, controller design using pole placement and optimal (LQR) control (introduction).  State observers are presented, including observer design using both pole placement and optimal (Kalman) observers (introduction).  Finally, a computer aided control system design methodology is applied to a real MIMO Aerospace platform and several other unstable MIMO systems."

Some knowledge of basic statistics is required. Experimental design will be emphasised, and the elements of statistical tests, including linear modelling, will be considered in a variety of biological, planning and legal contexts. Practical work involves use of structured thinking to resolving spatial problems of sampling, computers and software, and will complement methods introduced in lectures.  An understanding of the unique issues of problem solving marine sampling wave exposed and changing ocean environments are developed in a series of workshops.  These workshops provide a sampling and statistical basis for students to consider the fundamental elements of developing their own sampling or experimental projects in an actual or simulated marine environment.  This coverage of fundamental areas of sampling and statistical analysis, known to cause problems for marine biologists in their understanding and implementation of advice from statistician, bridges known gaps between biological training and industry needs."

These equations might be straightforward algebraic statements, or complicated systems of differential equations, but there are some fundamental questions common to all of these settings: does a solution exist? If so, is it unique? And if we know of the existence of some specific solution, how do we determine it explicitly or as accurately as possible?  This course develops the foundations required to rigorously establish the existence of solutions to various equations, thereby laying the basis for the study of such solutions.  Through an understanding of the foundations of analysis, we obtain insight critical in numerous areas of application, such areas ranging across physics, engineering, economics and finance.

Topics covered are: sets, functions, metric spaces and normed linear spaces, compactness, connectedness, and completeness.  Banach fixed point theorem and applications, uniform continuity and convergence. General topological spaces, generating topologies, topological invariants, quotient spaces. Introduction to Hilbert spaces and bounded operators on Hilbert spaces."

The course seeks to link theory and research to the practical application of ethical choices facing the finance and accounting professions. The conduct of stakeholders responsible for preparing and using financial information including moral dimensions and ethical aspects are interpreted through the application of various accounting and finance theories. This reinforces the role of finance and accounting professionals in a dynamic business environment and their significance to society in general. In accordance with various principle-based Association and Regulatory Codes of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct, a number of contemporary business issues are examined to illustrate these concepts."
